　　ANTI-POLLUTION NEEDS YOUR EFFORTS
　　People today are beginning to hear more &amp; more about the problem of 
pollution. Pollution is caused either by the release of artificial substances 
into the environment(人造物质的排放),or by increased amounts of natural substances, 
such as oil, from oil tankers into the sea.
　　Many people, therefore, see pollution as only part of a larger &amp; more 
complex problem. Whatever its underlying reasons, it is no doubt that much of 
the pollution could be controlled if companies, individuals &amp; governments 
would make more efforts. For instance, there is an obvious need to control 
litter &amp; waste, which everyone can help to do by cutting out excess 
consumption &amp; careless disposal of the products we use in our daily 
lives.
　　In a word, anti-pollution needs your efforts!
