
　　JOB PROBLEMS FOR GRADUATES
　　According to the statistics, only 58% of college graduates could find jobs 
in their specialties. Why do college graduates find it increasingly difficult to 
get a rewarding job?
　　One reason perhaps is that many colleges and universities fail to adapt 
their courses to the development of economy. Degree courses offered in these 
institutions of higher learning are so outdated, irrelevant and impractical that 
the students themselves find it hard to translate their book knowledge into real 
job skills. Second, there is an oversupply of graduates in certain 
specialties.
　　So many of them can not enter the professions for which they are trained. 
College graduates are valuable resources in our country. The problems they 
encounter in job hunting deserve more attention.
