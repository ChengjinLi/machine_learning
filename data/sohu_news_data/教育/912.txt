　　Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
　　Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:
　　When we state our opinions in informal situations, we often give little or no evidence to support them: “John is a reckless driver.” “The cost of living is going up every day.” “Divorce is the main cause of juvenile delinquency(青少年犯罪).”This does not mean that we have no good reasons for believing as we do, but simply that our reasons are usually known and accepted by our listeners. On occasions when our opinions are questioned, we may attempt to support them with facts drawn from our experience and reading: “John had two accidents last month, and he always drives too fast.” “Steak is up sixty cents a pound, and a refrigerator costs almost twice as much today as it did six years ago.” “Psychologists say that emotional stability depends on a secure family life.” Such evidence is considered acceptable or even convincing in informal situations, usually because the listener’s personal regard for the speaker lends some weight to the evidence.
　　In writing, however, the relationship with your audience is far more impersonal; authority must rest much more on the facts themselves. Readers who know neither John nor you will want to know what kind of accidents John had and who was at fault; they will wonder whether “too fast” means in excess of speed limits, they might suspect that “always” is an exaggeration. Before accepting your opinion in regard to the relation between divorce and delinquency, they may want to hear what psychologists say in their own words to be sure that you are not misinterpreting their remarks or ignoring opposed opinions.
　　The more facts supporting your opinion that you can gather from experience or from the written statements of others, the more reasons you can give your readers to accept that opinion. You will probably not be able to present absolute proof, but the greater the weight of your evidence, the more probable it will seem to them that your belief is the best one.
　　21. When we state our opinions in informal situations, evidence is often missing because _____.
　　A) we are unable to provide any evidence
　　B) we assume that it is clear without explanation
　　C) we are free from misjudgment
　　D) we are friends with our listeners
　　22. Usually, such evidence as provided in the first paragraph becomes more convincing if ___ .
　　A) the speaker emphasizes it several times B) the speaker shows great interest in it
　　C) the listener trusts the speaker D) the listener has secure family life
　　23. In writing, the statement “John is a reckless driver” is best supported by the sentence _____.
　　A) “He drives at 80 miles per hour every day”
　　B) “He drives very fast on his way to work”
　　C) “He is always careless when he drives on the highway”
　　D) “He has had several accidents this year”
　　24. Talking about psychology, a writer can convince his readers best with _______.
　　A) psychologists' original words B) other people's opposed opinions
　　C) his own remarks D) explanations for quoting psychologists
　　25. The writer of this passage is probably lecturing on a topic concerning _________.
　　A) interpersonal relationship B) modern American life
　　C) psychology D) writing
　　Passage Two
　　Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:
　　A scientist who does research in economic psychology and who wants to predict the way in which consumers will spend their money must study consumer behavior. He must obtain data both on resources of consumers and on the motives that tend to encourage or discourage money spending.
　　If an economist were asked which of three groups borrow most, people with rising incomes, stable incomes, or declining incomes--he would probably answer: those with declining incomes. Actually, in the years 1947--1950, the answer was: people with rising incomes. People with declining incomes were next and people with stable incomes borrowed the least. This shows us that traditional assumptions about earning and spending are not always reliable. Another traditional assumption is that if people who have money expect prices to go up, they will hasten to buy. If they expect prices to go down, they will postpone buying. But research surveys have shown that this is not always true. The typical attitude was expressed by the wife of a mechanic in an interview at a time of rising prices, "In a few months, " she said, "we'll have to pay more for meat and milk; we'll have less to spend on other things." Her family had been planning to buy a new car but they postponed this purchase. Furthermore, the rise in prices that has already taken place may be resented and buyer's resistance may be evoked. This is shown by the following typical comment: "I just don't pay these prices; they are too high."
　　The investigations mentioned above were carried out in America. Investigations conducted at the same time in Great Britain, however, yielded results that were more in agreement with traditional assumptions about saving and spending patterns. The condition most conducive(有助于) to spending appears to be price stability. If prices have been stable and people consider that they are reasonable, they are likely to buy. Thus, it appears that the common business policy of maintaining stable prices is based on a correct understanding of consumer psychology.
　　26. It can be inferred from the passage that if one wants to predict the way consumers will spend their money, he should ________.
　　A) rely on traditional assumptions about earning and spending
　　B) try to encourage or discourage consumers to spend money
　　C) carry our investigations on consumer behavior and obtain data on consumers' incomes and money spending motives
　　D) do researches in consumer psychology in a laboratory
　　27. According to Paragraph 2, research surveys have proved that ________.
　　A) price increases always stimulate people to hasten to buy things
　　B) rising prices may make people put off their purchase of certain things
　　C) women are more sensitive to the rising in prices than men
　　D) the expectations of price increases often make buyers feel angry
　　28. The results of the investigations on consumer psychology carried out in America were ________ those of the investigations made at the same time in Great Britain.
　　A) somewhat different from
　　B) exactly the same as
　　C) much better than
　　D) not as good as
　　29. From the results of the surveys, the writer of this article ________.
　　A) concludes that the saving and spending patterns in Great Britain are better than those in America.
　　B) concludes that the consumers always expect prices to remain stable
　　C) concludes that maintaining stable prices is a correct business policy
　　D) does not draw any conclusion
　　30. Which of the following statements is always TRUE according to the surveys mentioned in the passage?
　　A) Consumers will put off buying things if they expect prices to decrease.
　　B) Consumers will spend their money quickly if they expect prices to increase.
　　C) The price condition has an influence on consumer behavior.
　　D) Traditional assumptions about earning and spending are reliable.
　　Passage Three
　　Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　About six years ago I was eating lunch in a restaurant in New York City when a woman and a young boy sat down at the next table, I couldn't help overhearing parts of their conversation. At one point, the woman asked: "So, how have you been?" And the boy―who could not have been more than seven or eight years old―replied, "Frankly, I've been feeling a little depressed lately.''
　　This incident stuck in my mind because it confirmed my growing belief that children are changing. As far as I can remember, my friends and I didn't find out we were "depressed" until we were in high school.
　　The evidence of a change in children has increased steadily in recent years. Children don't seem childlike any more. Children speak more like adults, dress more like adults and behave more like adults than they used to.
　　Whether this is good or bad is difficult to say, but it certainly is different. Childhood as it once was no longer exists. Why?
　　Human development is based not only on innate (天生的) biological states, but also on patterns of access to social knowledge. Movement from one social rote to another usually involves learning the secrets of the new status. Children have always been taught adult secrets, but slowly and in stages: traditionally, we tell sixth graders things we keep hidden from fifth graders.
　　In the last 30 years, however, a secret-revelation (揭示) machine has been installed in 98 percent of American homes. It is called television. Television passes information, and indiscriminately (不加区分地), to all viewers alike, be they children or adults. Unable to resist the temptation, many children turn their attention from printed texts to the less challenging, more vivid moving pictures.
　　Communication through print, as a matter of fact, allows for a great deal of control over the social information to which children have access. Reading and writing involve a complex code of symbols that must be memorized and practiced. Children must read simple books before they can read complex materials.
　　31. According to the author, feeling depressed is ________.
　　A) a sure sign of a psychological problem in a child
　　B) something hardly to be expected in a young child
　　C) an inevitable sign of children's mental development
　　D) a mental scale present in all humans, including children
　　32. Traditionally, a child is supposed to learn about the adult world ________.
　　A) through contact with society C) naturally and by biological instinct
　　B) gradually and under guidance D)through exposure to social information
　　33. The phenomenon that today's children seem adult-like is attributed by the author to _ .
　　A) the widespread influence of television
　　B) the poor arrangement of teaching content
　　C) the fast pace of human intellectual development
　　D) the constantly rising standard of living
　　34. Why is the author in favor of communication through print for children?
　　A) It enables children to gain more social information.
　　B) It develops children's interest in reading and writing.
　　C) It helps children to memorize and practice more.
　　D) It can control what children are to learn.
　　35. What does the author think of the change in today's children?
　　A) He feels amused by their premature behavior.
　　B) He thinks it is a phenomenon worthy of note.
　　C) He considers it a positive development.
　　D) He seems to be upset about it.
　　Passage Four
　　Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
　　"Opinion" is a word that is used carelessly today. It is used to refer to matters of taste, belief, and judgment. This casual use would probably cause little confusion if people didn't attach too much importance to opinion. Unfortunately, most do attach great importance to it. "I have as much right to my opinion as you to yours, '' and ''Everyone's entitled to his opinion, '' are common expressions. In fact, anyone who would challenge another's opinion is likely to be branded intolerant.
　　Is that label accurate? Is it intolerant to challenge another's opinion? It depends on what definition of opinion you have in mind. For example, you may ask a friend ''What do you think of the new Ford cars?" And he may reply, "In my opinion, they're ugly." In this case, it would not only be intolerant to challenge his statement, but foolish. For it's obvious that by opinion he means his personal preference, a matter of taste. And as the old saying goes, ''It's pointless to argue about matters of taste."
　　But consider this very different use of the term, a newspaper reports that the Supreme Court has delivered its opinion in a controversial case. Obviously the justices did not shake their personal preferences, their mere likes and dislikes. They stated their considered judgment, painstakingly arrived at after thorough inquiry and deliberation.
　　Most of what is referred to as opinion falls somewhere between these two extremes. It is not an expression of taste. Nor is it careful judgment. Yet it may contain elements of both. It is a view or belief more or less casually arrived at, with or without examining the evidence.
　　Is everyone entitled to his opinion? Of course, this is not only permitted, but guaranteed. We are free to act on our opinions only so long as, in doing so, we do not harm others.
　　36. Which of the following statements is TRUE, according to the author?
　　A) Everyone has a right to hold his own opinion.
　　B) Free expression of opinions often leads to confusion.
　　C) Most people tend to be careless in forming their opinions.
　　D) Casual use of the word "opinion" often brings about quarrels.
　　37. According to the author, who of the following would be labeled as intolerant?
　　A) Someone who turns a deaf ear to others' opinions.
　　B) Someone who can't put up with others' tastes.
　　C) Someone who values only their own opinions.
　　D) Someone whose opinion harm other people.
　　38. The new Ford cars are cited as an example to show that ________.
　　A) it is foolish to criticize a famous brand
　　B) one should not always agree to others' opinions
　　C) personal tastes are not something to be challenged
　　D) it is unwise to express one's likes and dislikes in public
　　39. Considered judgment is different from personal preference in that ________.
　　A) it is stated by judges in the court
　　B) it reflects public likes and dislikes
　　C) it is a result of a lot of controversy
　　D) it is based on careful thought
　　40. As indicate, being free to act on one's opinion ________.
　　A) means that one can ignore other people's criticism
　　B) means that one can impose his preferences on others
　　C) doesn't mean that one has the right to do things at will
　　D) doesn't mean that one has the right to charge others without evidence

　　Generally speaking, a British is widely regarded as a quiet, shy and conservative person who is __71 only among those with whom he is acquainted. When a stranger is present, he often seems nervous, __72__ embarrassed. You have to take a commuter train any morning or evening to 73 the truth of this.
　　Serous-looking businessmen and women sit reading their newspapers or sleeping in a corner; hardly anybody talks, since to do so would be considered quite offensive. 74 , there is an unwritten but clearly understood code of behavior which, 75 broken, makes the offender immediately the object of 76 .
　　It has been known as a fact that the British has a _77 for the discussion of their weather and that, if given a chance, he will talk about it 78 .
