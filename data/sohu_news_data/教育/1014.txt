　　The homeless make up a growing percentage of America's population. 1 , 
homelessness has reached such proportions that local governments can't possibly 
2 . To help homeless people 3 independence, the federal government must support 
job training programs, 4 the minimum wage, and fund more low-cost housing.
　　5 everyone agrees on the number of Americans who are homeless. Estimates 6 
anywhere from 600,000 to 3 million. 7 the figure may vary, analysts do agree on 
another matter: that the number of the homeless is 8 . One of the federal 
government's studies 9 that the number of the homeless will reach nearly 19 
million by the end of this decade.
　　Finding ways to 10 this growing homeless population has become increasingly 
difficult. 11 when homeless individuals manage to find a 12 that will give them 
three meals a day and a place to sleep at night, a good number still spend the 
bulk of each day 13 the street. Part of the problem is that many homeless adults 
are addicted to alcohol or drugs. And a significant number of the homeless have 
serious mental disorders. Many others, 14 not addicted or mentally ill, simply 
lack the everyday 15 skills needed to turn their lives 16 . Boston Globe 
reporter Chris Reidy notes that the situation will improve only when there are 
17 programs that address the many needs of the homeless. 18 Edward Zlotkowski, 
director of community service at Bentley College in Massachusetts, 19 it, "There 
has to be 20 of programs. What's needed is a package deal."

　　ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)
　　[2006年试题]
　　On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of David 
Williams, 52, and of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling games are 
played). During several years of gambling in that casino, Williams, a state 
auditor earning $35,000 a year, lost approximately $175,000. He had never 
gambled before the casino sent him
　　a coupon for $20 worth of gambling.
　　He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he lost 
$800. The casino issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card," which when 
used in the casino earns points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to 
track the user's gambling activities. For Williams, those activities "became 
what he calls "electronic heroin."
　　(41) . In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two days. In March 
1997 he lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot machines at a time, all 
night, until the boat docked at 5 a.m., then went back aboard when the casino 
opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing the casino, charging that it should have 
refused his patronage because it knew he was addicted. It did know he had a 
problem.
　　In March 1998 a friend of Williams's got him involuntarily confined to a 
treatment center for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams's 
gambling problem. The casino included a photo of Williams among those of banned 
gamblers and wrote to him a "cease admissions" letter. Noting the 
"medical/psychological" nature of problem gambling behavior, the letter said 
that before being readmitted to the casino he would have to present 
medical/psychological information demonstrating that patronizing the casino 
would pose no threat to his safety or well-being.
　　(42) .
　　The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 24 signs warning: 
"Enjoy the fun.., and always bet with your head, not over it." Every entrance 
ticket lists a toll-free number for counseling from the Indiana Department of 
Mental Health. Nevertheless, Williams's suit charges that the casino, knowing he 
was "helplessly addicted to gambling," intentionally worked to "lure" him to 
"engage in conduct against his will." Well
　　(43) .
　　The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders says "pathological gambling" involves
　　persistent, recurring and uncontrollable pursuit less of money than of the 
thrill of taking risks in quest of a windfall.
　　(44) . Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, society is 
reclassifying what once were considered character flaws or moral failings as 
personality disorders akin to physical disabilities.
　　(45) .
　　Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these states 
are to varying degrees dependent on - you might say addicted to - revenues from 
wagering. And since the first Internet gambling site was created in 1995, 
competition for gamblers' dollars has become intense. The Oct. 28 issue of 
Newsweek reported that 2 million gamblers patronize 1,800 virtual casinos every 
week. With $3.5 billion being lost on Internet wagers this year, gambling has 
passed pornography as the Web's most profitable business.
　　[A] Although no such evidence was presented, the casino's marketing 
department continued to pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino and 
used his Fun Card without being detected.
　　[B] It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior. 
And in what sense was his will operative?
　　[C] By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he could get 
back to even, he would quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit.
　　[D] Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a 
long time it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a 
social policy: the most important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America 
is the government.
　　[E] David Williams's suit should trouble this gambling nation. But don't 
bet on it.
　　[F] It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral 
problems, often defining as addictions what earlier, sterner generations 
explained as weakness of will.
　　[G] The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of online gambling is 
especially conducive to compulsive behavior. But even
　　 if the government knew how to move against Internet gambling, what would 
be its grounds for doing so?
　　III. English-Chinese Translation
　　Part C
　　Directions: [2006年试题]
　　Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined 
segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER 
SHEET 2. (10 points)
　　Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no 
account in his society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father 
Bruckberger told part of the story when he observed that it is the intellectuals 
who have rejected America. But they have done more than that. They have grown 
dissatisfied with the role of the intellectual. It is they, not America, who 
have become anti-intellectual.
　　First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an 
intellectual? (46) I shall define him as an individual who has elected as his 
primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a Socratic (苏格拉底) 
way about moral problems. He explores such problems consciously, articulately, 
and frankly, first by asking factual questions, then by asking moral questions, 
finally by suggesting action which seems appropriate in the light of the factual 
and moral information which he has obtained. (47) His function is analogous to 
that of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a 
manner as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision.
　　This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as 
intellectuals -- the average scientist, for one. (48) I have excluded him 
because, while his accomplishments may contribute to the solution of moral 
problems, he has not been charged with the task of approaching any but the 
factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he encounters moral 
issues even in the everyday performance of his routine duties – he is not 
supposed to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. 
(49) But his primary task is not to think about the moral code which governs his 
activity, any more than a businessman is expected to dedicate his energies to an 
exploration of rules of conduct in business. During most of his waking life he 
will take his code for granted, as the businessman takes his ethics.
　　The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact 
that teaching has traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn 
their living. (50) They teach very well, and more than earn their salaries, but 
most of them make little or no independent reflections on human problems which 
involve moral judgment. The description even fits the majority of eminent 
scholars. Being learned in some branch of human knowledge is one thing; living 
in “public and illustrious thoughts,” as Emerson would say, is something else.
