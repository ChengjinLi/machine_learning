　　Global Shortage of Fresh Water
　　People often think that water will never be used up. There is plenty of 
water, such as rain, water from the rivers and wells. It seems as if water is 
always available around us and we never have to worry about water shortage.
　　In fact water is rather limited on the earth. With the rapid increase of 
population and fast development of industries, water is more needed than before. 
At the same time, a large amount of water has been polluted and wasted every 
day. Some big cities in China are facing the problem of water shorage already. 
There, water supply is controlled and industry has been restrained.
　　What should we do about the water shorage? I think, first, the people 
should be made aware of the real situation about the water. Everyone should 
consciously save on water and certain law should be made that no water will be 
polluted. We have to protect the existing water resources and develop new ones. 
In this way I believe that our cities will not be thirsty for water in the 
future.
